    <h1>DMCA policy</h1>
    <p>This Digital Millennium Copyright Act policy (&quot;Policy&quot;) applies to the <a target="_blank"
            rel="follow" href="https://assignmento.org">assignmento.org</a> website (&quot;Website&quot; or
        &quot;Service&quot;) and any of its related products and services (collectively, &quot;Services&quot;) and
        outlines how this Website operator (&quot;Operator&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;)
        addresses copyright infringement notifications and how you (&quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;) may submit a
        copyright infringement complaint.</p>
    <p>Protection of intellectual property is of utmost importance to us and we ask our users and their authorized
        agents to do the same. It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notifications of alleged copyright
        infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&quot;DMCA&quot;) of 1998, the
        text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office <a target="_blank"
            href="https://www.copyright.gov">website</a>. This DMCA policy was created with the help of the <a
            target="_blank" href="https://www.websitepolicies.com/dmca-policy-generator">DMCA policy generator</a>.</p>
    <h2>What to consider before submitting a copyright complaint</h2>
    <p>Please note that if you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to
        contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.</p>
    <p>The DMCA requires you to provide your personal information in the copyright infringement notification. If you are
        concerned about the privacy of your personal information, you may wish to <a target="_blank"
            href="https://www.copyrighted.com/professional-takedowns">hire an agent</a> to report infringing material
        for you.</p>
    <h2>Notifications of infringement</h2>
    <p>If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any material available on our Services
        infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a written copyright infringement notification
        (&quot;Notification&quot;) using the contact details below pursuant to the DMCA. All such Notifications must
        comply with the DMCA requirements. You may refer to a <a target="_blank"
            href="https://www.websitepolicies.com/create/dmca-takedown-notice">DMCA takedown notice generator</a> or
        other similar services to avoid making mistake and ensure compliance of your Notification.</p>
    <p>Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will be reviewed for
        accuracy, validity, and completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these requirements, our response may
        include the removal or restriction of access to allegedly infringing material.</p>
    <p>If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate an account in response to a Notification of alleged
        infringement, we will make a good faith effort to contact the affected user with information concerning the
        removal or restriction of access, along with instructions for filing a counter-notification.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, the Operator reserves the right
        to take no action upon receipt of a DMCA copyright infringement notification if it fails to comply with all the
        requirements of the DMCA for such notifications.</p>
    <h2>Counter-notifications</h2>
    <p>A user who receives a copyright infringement Notification may make a counter-Notification pursuant to sections
        512(g)(2) and (3) of the US Copyright Act. If you receive a copyright infringement Notification, it means that
        the material described in the Notification has been removed from our Services or access to the material has been
        restricted. Please take the time to read through the Notification, which includes information on the
        Notification we received.</p>
    <p>Please note that if you are not sure whether certain material infringes the copyrights of others or that the
        material or activity was removed or restricted by mistake or misidentification, you may wish to contact an
        attorney before filing a counter-notification.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, the Operator reserves the right
        to take no action upon receipt of a counter-notification. If we receive a counter-notification that complies
        with the terms of 17 U.S.C. ยง 512(g), we may forward it to the person who filed the original Notification.</p>
    <p>The process described in this Policy does not limit our ability to pursue any other remedies we may have to
        address suspected infringement.</p>
    <h2>Changes and amendments</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms relating to the Website and Services at any time,
        effective upon posting of an updated version of this Policy on the Website. When we do, we will post a
        notification on the main page of the Website.</p>
    <h2>Reporting copyright infringement</h2>
    <p>If you would like to notify us of the infringing material or activity, you may send an email to
        u&#115;&#97;&#109;&#97;s&#97;&#114;wa&#114;of&#102;&#105;ci&#97;&#108;&#64;&#103;mail.com.</p>
